My name is Saidul Alam Chowdhury, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.inu.ac.kr/inu/index.do">Incheon National University</a>.
My research revolves around improving the conducted EMI and the overall performances of the wireless power transfer system.

Here's what you'll find on this website. Under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, 
I maintain a list of my publications and research projects. 
On the <a href="/cv">CV</a> tab, you can find my updated CV. 
Please find my contact information below this page, as well as other links.
