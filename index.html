<p>Hello there, I'm glad you've stopped by my homepage!!<br>
    
<br>
My name is Saidul Alam Chowdhury, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.inu.ac.kr/">Incheon National University</a>.
My research revolves around improving the system performances of the wireless power transfer.

Here's what you'll find on this website. Under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, 
I maintain a list of my publications and research projects. 
On the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab, you can find a bunch of my other projects. 
Please find my contact information below this page, as well as other links.
