		<b>3D Saqqara- An Interactive Egypt</b>: This project aims at visualizing uncertainty (mentioned above in Uncertainty: The Art of Speculation) by using selected 3D models from a specified time period. One approach our team considered is using the selected model and reconstructing their missing components and textures using tools such as Blender. We can later visualize parts of the model by referencing what they may look like based on similar models found in the same time period. One of our goals is to create shifting views of the model; the user can look at the models through a first-person view or glance at them from a bird's eye view. Creating multiple views provides the user with a more detailed visualization. <br>

		<b>Colored Pencil Box - A Branching Narrative</b>: "Colored Pencil Box" is a nonlinear branching narrative written as a collaborative fiction in Bangla.

Colored Pencil Box is an attempt to experiment with collaborative fiction and branching narrative. <br>
